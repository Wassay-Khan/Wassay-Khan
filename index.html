              Cooperated with a large team to conceptualize, design, model, and create a working battle bot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Individual parts were modeled in CAD software, and final parts were created in the machine shop through the use of the mill, lathe, sander, electrical saw, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Final robot was used in competition against 16 other teams, with a placement in the top 8.
